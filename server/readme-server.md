This folder contains I tiny gateway server, that handles connection and authorization against the google api.

Why? because I did not manage to get the api code working inside the browser.

### node get-authorization.js 
will use or create the data/credentials.json to get a data/token.json for all future requests. So you have to run this only once before starting the server for the first time.

### node . 
will start the server
